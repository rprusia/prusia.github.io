<h1>Recommendations working with GIT using Intellij</h1>

<h2>Frequency of Pulling from master.</h2>

<p>It is recommended you Pull from master regularly each day, once
    in morning and before quitting for the day.  Doing this will prevent merge
    conflicts when you are ready to create a Pull request.</p>

<h2>Change List</h2>
•	Monitor your change list and rollback, commit and stash files as needed.
•	It is a good idea to clean up your change list before doing a Pull, it may prevent error messages that can pop up when Pulling code from master.
•	Once you commit, rollback or stash a file it will be removed from the change list.
•	It is possible to create multiple change list.
