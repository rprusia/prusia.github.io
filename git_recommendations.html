<h1>Recommendations working with GIT using Intellij</h1>

<div>
    <h2>Frequency of Pulling from master</h2>

    <p>It is recommended you Pull from master at a miniumum of once per day.  Doing this will prevent merge
        conflicts when you are ready to create a Pull request and will ensure you have updated code when working on your
        project.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Change List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Monitor your change list and rollback, commit and stash files as needed.</li>
        <li>It is a good idea to clean up your change list before doing a Pull, it may prevent error messages that can pop
            up when Pulling code from master.</li>
        <li>Once you commit, rollback or stash a file it will be removed from the change list.  But the stashed code can be
            retrieved from the GIT stash menu and applied to any branch.</li>
        <li>It is possible to create multiple change list, to verify separate out your changes.</li>
        <li>The change list is also a good way to keep track of the files you are currently working on for particular piece
            of functionality.</li>

    <h2>Frequently used GIT Commands</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Fetch:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Gets new data from commits that were made since your last sync with remote
            repository. &nbsp;&nbsp;The new data is not integrated into your local files and changes
            are not applied to your code.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fetched changes are stored as a remote branch, which gives you a chance to
            review them before merging into your working branch</li>
        <li><b>Pull:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Pulling changes from a remote repository is a convenient shortcut for fetching and
            subsequently merging changes. When you Pull, you not only download new data, but also integrates it into your
            local working copy of the project.</li>
        <li><b>Commit:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>You must Commit your files locally so they can be pushed, only commit files that you
            want pushed to remote server.  If a file is not committed it will not be included in a Push command.</li>
        <li><b>Push:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Uploads committed files to remote server.
            <ul>
                <li>Depending on your rights you may be able to push directly to master branch, but the best practice is
                    to push to branch other than master</li>
                <li>Then verify your changes and then create pull request so your code can be reviewed before merging
                    to master.</li>
                <li>Only Commit changes you want staged for the PUSH.  Make sure you are adding meaningful commit messages,
                    because commit messages are stored as history.  At times we may need the commit messages when
                    trying to determine issues caused by certain commits.  Other developers will get your commit
                    messages when they pull code from master,  so meaningful Commit messages are very important.</li>
                <li>Before doing a Push it is a good idea to pull the latest code from master.  When doing a pull git will
                    merge master into your local branch, it will also let you know if you have any merge conflicts
                    that need to be resolved.  It will allow you to merge those conflicts, before you push the code.</li>
                <li>After doing a pull your code is up to date, and you can proceed to PUSH your code and then create Pull Request.</li>
                <li>Doing the above will help avoid conflicts with your pull request.</li>
            </ul>
