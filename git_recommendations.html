<h1>Recommendations working with GIT using Intellij</h1>

<div>
    <h2>Frequency of Pulling from master.</h2>

    <p>It is recommended you Pull from master at a miniumum of once per day.  Doing this will prevent merge
        conflicts when you are ready to create a Pull request and will ensure you have updated code when working on your
        project.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Change List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Monitor your change list and rollback, commit and stash files as needed.</li>
        <li>It is a good idea to clean up your change list before doing a Pull, it may prevent error messages that can pop
            up when Pulling code from master.</li>
        <li>Once you commit, rollback or stash a file it will be removed from the change list.  But the stashed code and be
            retrieved from the GIT stash menu.</li>
        <li>It is possible to create multiple change list, to verify separate out your changes.</li>
        <li>The change list is also a good way to keep track of the files you are currently working on for particular piece
            of functionality.</li>

    <h2>Frequently used GIT Commands</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Fetch:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Gets new data from commits that were made since your last sync with remote
            repository. &nbsp;&nbsp;The new data is not integrated into your local files and changes
            are not applied to your code.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fetched changes are stored as a remote branch, which gives you a chance to
            review them before merging into your working branch</li>
        <li><b>Pull:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Pulling changes from a remote repository is a convenient shortcut for fetching and
            subsequently merging changes. When you Pull, you not only download new data, but also integrates it into your
            local working copy of the project.</li>
        <li><b>Commit:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>You must Commit your files locally so they can be pushed, only commit files that you
            want pushed to remote server.  If a file is not committed it will not be included in a Push command.</li>
        <li><b>Push:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Uploads committed files to remote server.
            <ul>
                <li>Depending on your rights you may be able to push directly to master branch, but the best practice is
                    to push to branch other than master</li>
                <li>Then verify your changes and then create pull request so your code can be reviewed before merging
                    to master.</li></ul>

            </li>
    </ul>
